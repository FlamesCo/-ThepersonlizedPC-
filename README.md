# The Personalized Computer Project

The Personalized Computer Mark II  is a specialized Silicon Graphics Indigo workstation, theorized to have played a role in the development of Super Mario 64, particularly the Personalization AI. Despite its external resemblance to an unmodified Indigo workstation, it harbors notable firmware and software alterations. This system is conjectured to operate on a derivative of the IRIX OS, featuring a mildly altered GUI and a significantly modified kernel. [It adapts the personalization based on user prompts and can utilize outsourced metadata from Google/YouTube, as well as video source files. In case of errors, it complies with the software/api/chat prompt.] This can be used in any GPT-[X] Setting [GPT-3 Example]
